# Project Proposal

1) Collaboration
Shashanka Sharma

2) Project title
MyCryptoPal

3) What and why?
A full-stack web application that allows users to search for various pieces of financial data pertaining to a particular cryptocurrency.
A large component of finance is making models based around particular financial equations to determine whether a stock is a good/bad investment. 
This project aims to calculate those same financial ratios for cryptocurrencies and present it to end-users in the hopes that it helps users make more educated investments.

4) For whom?
Anyone interested in trading cryptocurrencies can use the app, but I figure the app will focus on retail investors. 

5) How?
Users can register an account on the website and log in to their account.
Users can search for cryptocurrencies and receive current market data.
Users can favorite their top cryptocurrencies, which will be presented to them in the initial home page.
Users can invest in a paper trading simulator on the cryptocurrencies they like, allowing users to practice trading without financial risk.

6) Scope
The scope of the project as of now seems quite feasible in my opinion. I expect most issues to pertain to backend development, such as creating the database to carry out fundamentals tasks of the application. Gathering financial data would require a public API, understanding how to work with a specific API may be challenging. Updating information on the site regularly to fit market conditions, which is constantly fluctuating may also be challenging, but other than that, most of the work is simply building the application, and I believe with a team of motivated developers, it is possible.
